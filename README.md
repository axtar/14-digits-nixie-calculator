## WARNING: nixies need high voltage to light up. If you choose to build or use the calculator, you are doing so at your own risk.
#### Notes:
- **This repository does not contain a complete project design. The design of the high voltage power supply (170V / â‰¥45mA) is not provided.**
- **Be aware that I'm just an electronics hobbyist and nixie enthusiast. However, this repository is only intended for suitable qualified electronics engineers who are familiar with nixie tubes.**
- **Please read all documents in [Docs](Docs) before deciding whether to build the calculator.**
- **I'm not affiliated with any of the service providers named in this project.**
